# Diet-Optimisation
This project presents a comparative study of two optimization techniques—Linear Programming (LP) and Simulated Annealing (SA)—for nutritional diet planning using the USDA Food Composition Database. The goal is to generate diets that meet specific nutritional requirements, balancing factors like diversity, constraint satisfaction, and personalization.

Key components include:

Use of the USDA dataset with 7,000+ food items and 14 nutritional properties

Nutritional targets based on ICMR guidelines for an average adult

Implementation of LP for fast, deterministic, constraint-satisfying diets

Application of SA for flexible, diverse, and more realistic diet generation

Evaluation based on nutrient compliance, variety, personalization, and runtime

LP offered high-speed solutions ideal for structured use-cases like hospitals or school meal programs, while SA allowed for more adaptable, human-centered diets suited for personalized applications. The study highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and realistic meal planning, proposing potential hybrid approaches for future development.
